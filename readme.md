College project to create a digital version of the game Monopoly, encompassing all rules and functionalities.
After completion of this, we expanded to create a bot that played against classmates. Our bot placed 3rd.

This project gave us valuable experience with Object Oriented Programming, Version Control and Teamwork.

Team Members: Fiachra Dunn, Lucy Byrne, Michael Jordan
